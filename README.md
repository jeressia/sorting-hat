# Sorting Hat
This is a page created using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 4, and JavaScript. A user is able to enter their name and be assigned one of four houses from Harry Potter. The student's name and newly assigned class will then appear as a card. The user has the option to expel a student and delete their card from the list of other students.
